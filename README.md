# Honestly Unknown amount of Goodness Protection (HUG Protection)


A overpowered version of pgp. Uses quantum-proof NTRUEncrypt as well as triple-AES and triple-Twofish for symmetric. 
Designed to be a stronghold against quantum computing and extreme bruteforcing powers.
Warning: system has not been subjected to cryptanalysis, likely to have many vulenrabilities, hence the 'honestly unknown'.
